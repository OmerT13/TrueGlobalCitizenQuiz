# True Global Citizen Quizz
* This is a simple Android application that loops through five true/false questions
* It was my first attempt at an Android app and hence, I wanted to keep it simple
* It is designed on a Linear View and makes use of Toasts to tell whether the answer is correct
* To keep things simple, the questions were stored in an xml
